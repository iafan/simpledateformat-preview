# About

This is a very simple web server that allows you to construct and preview [Java SimpleDateFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html)-formatted date and time, which is useful for development and localization purposes. Since it is written in Java, it is guaranteed to give you a canonical output, unlike SimpleDateFormat-compatible implementations available for other languages.

# Running the server

Provided you have Java installed, you can compile and run the server by using the supplied script:

    $ ./run-server

Then open http://localhost:8000/ to open the web page.
