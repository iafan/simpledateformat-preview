# About

This is a very simple web server that allows you to construct and preview [Java SimpleDateFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html)-formatted date and time, which is useful for development and localization purposes.

Then open http://localhost:8000/ to open the web page.
